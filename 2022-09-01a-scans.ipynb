        "To do so, observe that every time we access `prices[i]`, we access `min_prices[i]`, which occurs at the _same_ position in their respective lists. The \"higher-level\" concept here is that we are _pairing off_ elements of two collections of the same size. Therefore, we can iterate over them _in parallel_, which is an idiom called a **zipper iteration**. The name comes from the image of a zipper on your clothes, where the teeth are paired off."

That means the computational algorithm takes $\\mathcal{O}(n+k)$ steps. In this case, doubling the input or output will double the computational cost, which seems like a reasonable price to pay."

Learning these idioms helps improve the readability of your code by making it more concise and using patterns that should be familiar to other Python programmers. The examples you saw here included **slicing for lists**, **higher-level functions** (like `sum` and `accumulate`), **list comprehensions** (use judiciously!), **helper functions**, and **zipper iteration**."

These are functions that take other functions as input and use them. List comprehensions are one example: the comprehension `[f(e) for e in x]` works for any function `f` that can take the input `e`. The use of `accumulate` customized to do additions (the default), multiplications, minimums, or whatever it is you need to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, are all additional examples."
